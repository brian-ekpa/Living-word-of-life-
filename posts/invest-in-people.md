“For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” — Matthew 6:21

In a world where material things are often valued more than relationships, Jesus reminds us to invest where it truly matters — in the hearts and lives of people.

Possessions fade, trends change, and wealth can disappear. But when we love, serve, forgive, and encourage others, we build something that cannot be lost — a lasting legacy of faith.
