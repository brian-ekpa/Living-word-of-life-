    </section>

    <section class="content" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto; padding: 1rem;">
      <p><strong>Living Word of Life</strong> was born out of a deep love for God’s Word and a desire to share its truth and encouragement with others daily.</p>

      <p>This blog is maintained by a loving grandma who has spent many years meditating on the Scriptures, and her grandchild, who helps share her daily insights and devotionals online for the world to see.</p>

      <p>Here, you’ll find daily devotionals, Bible verses, and spirit-filled reflections to uplift, strengthen, and draw you closer to Jesus.</p>

      <p>We pray this site becomes a place of peace and blessing for all who visit. Thank you for stopping by!</p>
